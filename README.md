# HTML + CSS Editing Project
 
 First, what I did to the site (coolmath.com) was I changed the background color from a dark blue to a dark pink. Then I messed around with the pixels, separating the body of the website from the header of the website by about 100 pixels. Finally, I changed the text for most of the games on the front page of the website to silly names like "This Game is Trash Ben is Amazing" and other things like that. I also changed the descriptions of the games. The links to to the games and other things stayed the same, I just changed the text.
